If you have enabled 2-factor authentication on your Google account
you can't use your regular password to access Gmail programmatically.
You need to generate an app-specific password and use that in place of your actual password.

Steps:

Log in to your Google account
Go to My Account > Sign-in & Security > App Passwords
(Sign in again to confirm it's you)
Scroll down to Select App (in the Password & sign-in method box) and choose Other (custom name)
Give this app password a name, e.g. "nodemailer"
Choose Generate
Copy the long generated password and paste it into your Node.js script instead of your actual Gmail password. (You don't need the spaces.)
Your script will now look like this:

var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'YOUR-GMAIL-USERNAME@gmail.com',
    pass: 'YOUR-GENERATED-APP-PASSWORD'
  }
});
I hope this helps someone.
